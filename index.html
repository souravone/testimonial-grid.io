            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had
            an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
            and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
            12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
